const fallbackInsight = getFallbackInsight(chartType, chartTitle, productData);
```

### Backend Analytics
```javascript
// Fetch comprehensive analytics
const response = await fetch('/api/analytics');
const analytics = await response.json();

// Access specific metrics
const totalRevenue = analytics.summary.totalRevenue;
